# Node Hello World

## Objectives

1. Implement Hello World in Node
1. Run the script from the terminal


## Introduction

In this lab, you'll practice how to run Node scripts from command line. In addition, you'll develop your first Node application—Hello World, the traditional first app in any language.

## Instructions

1. Create file `hello-world.js` and open it in your favorite editor
2. Output "Hello World" with `console.log()` which works similarly to browser JavaScript, i.e., prints text.
3. Launch the script from command line / terminal / command prompt with `$ node hello-world` (`.js` is optional).
4. Observe the output
5. Install testing dependencies with `$ npm install` (`$` is a symbol which tells you that this is a command line command)
6. Run tests with `$ npm test`

Tip: Don't overthink it.
